# üï∑Ô∏è Lightshot Screenshot Crawler

This project is an **automated web crawler** that navigates through **public screenshots on [prnt.sc](https://prnt.sc)**, verifies their validity, and saves them locally. Each image is identified by a 6-character alphanumeric code (e.g., `abc123`, `4bv53p`, `1s298h`, etc.).

The crawler is designed to be **slow but stealthy**, mimicking human behavior to avoid bans and rate-limiting.
